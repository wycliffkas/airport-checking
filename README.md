## Frontend Engineer exercise

The user wants to do check-in on the way to the airport using a mobile phone.

How we believe the user should do it:

The user should provide his flight number and last name
Afterwards, fill a simple form with basic information based on his nationality
The user should be able to review the information before confirming
In the last step, the user should see the confirmation page. :)
Every user should provide the following basic info: full name, nationality, phone number, e-mail, passport number and terms & conditions acceptance.

Test Data
1. LastName - Doe, Flight - 001
2. LastName - Kasirye, Flight - 001
3. LastName - Walugembe, Flight - 002
